This is a 2D tower defense game created using Java. It's purpose was to learn game developement from ground levels, so I chose to not use any game engine.

## About the game:

There are 10 levels, each containing different amounts of enemy waves, enemies and their
amount. Goal is to survive all 10 levels without letting the enemies reach the end goal. Each wave has a countdown timer. There is a gold system implemented in the game. You gain gold by killing enemies. You can also use gold to buy and upgrade towers to deal more damage, increase tower range or even increase attack speed. There is also save/load system implemented using .txt files.
